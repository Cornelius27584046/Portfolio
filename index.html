        <h1>Welcome to <span class="blue_color">Cornelius Frylinck's</span> Portfolio  </h1>
        <h3>Development is life</h3>
        <p>I enjoy Game-, Web- and Software Development. 
          I am currently finishing my 3-year Bsc in 
          Computer Science degree and I will go on to 
          finish my Honnors in CS in 2021. 
          During my vacation between the first and 
          second semesters of 2020, I have started 
          working to follow courses and tutorials that 
          are teaching me to improve my Web development, 
          Web design, Java development, C++ development 
          and my Godot Game development.
